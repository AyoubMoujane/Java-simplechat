# java-simplechat
School project : building a chat application with Java by using the OCSF framework and adding new functionalities throughout the versions 
to familiarize with good design principles and design patterns.

For the documentation I used draw.io to draw UML class diagrams
And simple pdf files to write comment about the current version

There are 3 versions which you can check by exploring v1, v2 or v3 branches.
